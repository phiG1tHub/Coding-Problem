class Problem_266{ /*.

This problem was asked by Pivotal.

A step word is formed by taking a given word, adding a letter, and anagramming the result. 
For example, starting with the word "APPLE", you can add an "A" and anagram to get "APPEAL".

Given a dictionary of words and an input word, create a function that returns all valid step words.

We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As always, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.

Have a great day! */
