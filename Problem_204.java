/*
 * This is your coding interview problem for today.
 * 
 * This problem was asked by Amazon.
 * 
 * Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in faster than O(n)
 * time. Recall that a complete binary tree has every level filled except the
 * last, and the nodes in the last level are filled starting from the left.
 * 
 * We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As
 * always, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.
 * 
 * Have a great day!
